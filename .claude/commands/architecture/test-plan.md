Create a comprehensive testing strategy for: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions
Develop a thorough testing plan covering all testing levels:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Identify all units (functions, methods, classes)
   - Define test cases for happy paths
   - Cover edge cases and error conditions
   - Specify mocking requirements
   - Set coverage targets

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Identify component interactions
   - Test data flow between components
   - Verify external API integrations
   - Test database interactions
   - Include contract testing

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Define user journey scenarios
   - Test complete workflows
   - Include cross-browser/device testing
   - Verify performance under load
   - Test error recovery paths

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Define load testing scenarios
   - Set response time expectations
   - Plan stress testing
   - Include scalability testing

5. **Security Testing**:
   - Identify security vulnerabilities
   - Test authentication/authorization
   - Include input validation testing
   - Test for common attacks (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
   - Review data encryption and privacy

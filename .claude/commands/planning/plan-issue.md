Generate a comprehensive GitHub issue for the feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions
Analyze the requested feature and create a detailed GitHub issue that includes:

1. **Overview**: Clear feature description and business value
2. **Scope**: Detailed feature boundaries and what's included/excluded
3. **Technical Requirements**: Architecture, APIs, data models needed
4. **Implementation Phases**: Break down into manageable phases with realistic timelines
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable criteria for completion
6. **Success Metrics**: KPIs to measure feature success
7. **Dependencies**: Other features, teams, or external dependencies
8. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing approach
9. **Risks & Mitigations**: Potential challenges and solutions

## Steps
1. Research the codebase to understand current implementation
2. Identify similar patterns or existing features
3. Analyze the feature's complexity and impact
4. Create comprehensive issue with all sections above
5. Suggest realistic timelines based on current codebase complexity
6. Include relevant code examples and technical details
7. Assign appropriate labels (enhancement, feature-request, etc.)

Focus on creating actionable, well-structured issues that developers can immediately understand and implement.

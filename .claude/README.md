## Features

### üéØ Structured Output
All commands generate structured, professional output that can be directly used in:
- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Documentation files
- Team discussions
- Project planning sessions

### üîß Customizable Templates
Commands use templates that can be easily customized for your specific:
- Technology stack (Rails, React, etc.)
- Team workflows
- Documentation standards
- Code quality requirements

### üìã Actionable Items
Each command provides:

- Accurate complexity estimates
- Appropriate technology recommendations
- Context-sensitive best practices

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Planning
Use planning commands to establish clear requirements and scope before development:
```
/plan-issue feature-name
/breakdown complex task
```

### 2. Ensure Quality
Use architecture and code quality commands throughout development:
```
/architecture-review new-component
/refactor-suggestions problematic-file
/test-plan new-feature
```

### 3. Document Everything
Use documentation commands to maintain comprehensive documentation:
```
/docs feature-description
/update-readme relevant-section
/changelog new-version
```

### 4. Monitor and Analyze
Regularly use analysis commands to track project health:
```
/performance-report monthly
/tech-debt-analysis critical-modules
/code-review-summary latest-pr
```

### 5. Deploy Safely
Use DevOps commands for reliable deployments:
```
/deployment-checklist production
/security-audit sensitive-component

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
- Ensure the `.claude/commands/` directory structure is correct
- Check that command files have proper frontmatter
- Verify filenames match the command names

### Arguments Not Working
- Use proper argument syntax: `$1`, `$2`, or `$ARGUMENTS`
- Check argument hints in command frontmatter
- Ensure arguments are properly escaped

### Output Not Contextual
- Commands analyze your codebase for relevance
- Ensure you're in the correct project directory
- Check that the codebase is accessible to Claude
